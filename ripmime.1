.SH "DESCRIPTION"
ripMIME is a command line tool used to aid in the extraction of email borne attachments to files which can be processed using other UNIX tools.  ripMIME supports both the RFC MIME standards as well as being able to behave according to various MUA 'features' which are often used as exploitation holes.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.LP 
.TP 
\-i
Input MIME encoded file (use '\-' to input from STDIN)

.TP 
\-d
Output directory
.TP 
\-p 
Specify prefix filename to be used on files without a filename (default 'text')
.TP 
\-e [headers file name]
Dump headers from mailpack (default '_headers_')
.TP 
\-v
Turn on verbosity
.TP 
\-q
Run quietly, do not report non\-fatal errors

.TP 
\-\-verbose\-contenttype
Turn on verbosity of file content type
.TP 
\-\-verbose\-oldstyle
Uses the v1.2.x style or filename reporting
.TP 
\-\-verbose\-defects
Report MIME header/body defects located in the mailpack
.TP 
\-\-stdout
All reporting goes to stdout (Default)
.TP 
\-\-stderr
All reporting goes to stderr
.TP 
\-\-syslog
All reporting goes to syslog
.TP 
\-\-no\-paranoid
[ Deprecated ] Turns off strict ascii\-alnum filenaming
.TP 
\-\-paranoid
Converts all filenames to strict 7\-bit compliance
.TP 
\-\-name\-by\-type
Saves a given attachment by its content\-type if it has no other name
.TP 
\-\-no\-nameless
Do not save nameless attachments
.TP 
\-\-overwrite
Overwrite files if they have the same name on extraction
.TP 
\-\-unique\-names
Dont overwrite existing files (This is the default behaviour)
.TP 
\-\-prefix
rename by putting unique code at the front of the filename
.TP 
\-\-postfix
rename by putting unique code at the end of the filename
.TP 
\-\-infix
rename by putting unique code in the middle of the filename
.TP 
\-\-recursion\-max <maximum level>
Set the maximum recursion level into a mailpack.  Often emails are forwarded copies of an existing email, each time this is done a new recursion level is required.  Malicious emails can be constructed with many hundereds of recursion levels to induce stack faults in decoding programs.  ripMIME is hard coded with a default of 20 levels, this may be overidden using this parameter.
.TP 
\-\-mailbox
Process mailbox file
.TP
\-\-formdata
Inibit the default conversion of NULL, zero-value bytes to spaces in data, which is normally done to facilitate text parsing but will break raw binary content if present. 
.TP 
\-\-extended\-errors
Returns error codes for non\-fatal decoding situations
.TP 
\-\-debug
Produces detailed information about the whole decoding process

.SS "Attachment type decoding switches"
.TP 
\-\-no\-tnef
Turn off TNEF/winmail.dat decoding
.TP 
\-\-no\-ole
Turn off OLE decoding
.TP 
\-\-no\-uudecode
Turns off the facility of detecting UUencoded attachments in emails
.TP 
\-\-no\-quotedprintable
Turns off the facility of decoding QuotedPrintable data
.TP 
\-\-no\-doublecr
Turns off saving of double\-CR embedded data
.TP 
\-\-no\-mht
Turns off MHT (a Microsoft mailpack attachment format ) decoding
.TP 
\-\-disable\-qmailbounce
Turns off ripMIME's look\-ahead searching for RFC822 headers within a body of text. Normally the look\-ahead is useful for decoding embedded emails which have been bounced back by systems like qmail, but have been included in such a way that they are not meant to be decoded, unfortunately some MUA (Outlook for one) still decode it, hence we need to by default check for attachments in such forwarded bodies.
.TP 
\-\-no\-multiple\-filenames
Turns off the behaviour of handling multiple filename occurances in a single MIME header. Normally ripMIME will generate a hard link for each additional filename beyond the original attachment filename detected.

.SS Auxillary parameters
.TP 
\-\-buildcodes
Displays the information obtained by the Makefile script when ripMIME was built.  This includes the Unix timestamp, human readable version of the timestamp and the output from 'uname \-a'.
.TP 
\-V \-\-version
Give version information
.TP 
\-h
Terse information on how to use ripMIME.
