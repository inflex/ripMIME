20081101-0215:PLD:DEV
	Cleaned up source code to make sure it builds without 
	errors with the new stricter build defaults on many
	systems (such as Ubuntu 8.10).  

	Changed the old bytedecoders file to now use the more
	sane get_uintX() and get_intX() type calls that make
	a bit more sense, also solves the annoying signed
	return value casting issues.

20051231-1055:PLD:
	---Development update
	Improved the image signature detection routines to allow for
	variable length signatures and possible non-zero offsets.
	Signatures are now stored as an array of struct typesig.

	It could be possible to use an external filetype signature
	library to do this process but because we're only wanting to
	seek out images and of very few formats it simply isn't 
	worth the overheads or speed penalty (we don't want to have 
			to search through 200 bytes looking for up to 1000 
			different filetypes).

20051224-1030:PLD:
	---Development update
	Added primative image detection routines to pull out PNG
	or JPG encoded data from an Escher formatted stream.  The
	Escher format is rather complex so for now instead of trying
	to decode it properly we just scan ahead in the data a short
	distance to look for specific PNG or JPG signatures.

20051212-1100:PLD:
	---Version 0.2.0 RELEASE
	Fixed up OLE Stream decoding - attachments now come out with
	 the stream headers correctly stripped off. FINALLY!

	Reverted the sector-ID handling back to a SIGNED 4-byte 
	integer, as negative values are required to signal 
	special sector ID's.

20050315-1544:PLD:
	Added last-sector check sanitisation while stepping along
	FAT/miniFAT streams

20050119-2108:PLD: 
	Added filename sanitization, so that obscure 8-bit values
		didn't get used.  See OLEUNWRAP_sanitize_filename()

20041127-2051:PLD: 
	Added sanity checking for the OLE header, see the fn
		OLE_header_sanity_check().  If the OLE file fails
		the sanity check, a return code of 103 will be 
		issued.

2004-Oct-18:
	Changed unsigned int sectors to signed in OLE_follow_minichain()
	so that negative sector requests could be detected and 
	prevent segfaults.  Thanks to Gabriele Cariole for supplying
	the offending mailpack.

2004-Sep-30:
	Added a loop detection system into OLE_follow_chain
	to detect situations where the loop isn't tight
	(ie, if it goes A->B->C->D->A). This requires two new
	files to be added to the archive (bt-int.[ch])

	Thanks to Brian for offering the mailpack which exposed
	this condition.


2004-Sep-25:
	Fixed old style fprintf(stdout) logging calls.

	Removed exit(1) calls.

	Fixed up memory leak in OLE_get_block(), where bb would not
	be explicitly free'd on either errors or normal exit.

2004-Aug-16:
	Added ole->FAT_limit into the general OLE struct so that when
	traversing the FAT chain later, it can be possible to check 
	for requests beyond the memory block limit (which would other-
			wise cause segfaults)

2004-Jul-17:
	Fixed up unwanted verbosity about read mismatch in ole.c:321
	Added macro VOLE which is 'if (ole->verbose)'.

	Fixed up unwanted verbosity from ole when a negative sector 
	read request is made and not in verbosity mode. (ole.c:891)

2004-May-22:
	Fixed up minifat walk routines, made current_sector comparisons
		use hex notation rather than assumed signed int comparison.

	Added start section sanity checking with minifat walker. ie, 
		ensuring that the starting sector is infact greater than zero
		
2004-May-21:
	Fixed up various memory leaks which were due to premature function
		exits, but without cleaning up any preallocated memory blocks.


2004-Apr-5:
	19H50:PLD:REL
		Released as v0.1.3

	19H48:PLD:DEV
		Added 'help' output for when no paramters are given.

	14H22:PLD:DEV
		Added stream size sanity checking when decoding the attachment size in 
		olestream-unwrap which would occasionally generate some rather unlrealistc
		stream sizes.  OLEUNWRAP_decode_attachment();

	01H21:PLD:DEV
		Finally fixed occasional segfault bug with some OLE2 files. 
		Fix was to define the memory boundary limit of the ole properties
		field and check on each pass of the loop that it wasn't being
		breached.
		

2003-Nov-26:
	20H13:PLD:DEV
		Release 0.0.4
		Fixed up some potential logging segfaults if used in 
		conjunction with syslog output.

2003-Nov-17:
	16H20:PLD:DEV
		Added bounds checking to entire processing system so that 
		it cannot request a sector outside of the real limits of 
		the loaded OLE file.
		I consider this only to be a partial fix to a problem of 
		various documents which do not seem to be able to be decoded
		reliably, fortunately at least the bounds checking stops the
		segfaults.

2003-Oct-31:
	07H38:PLD:DEV
		Added -q (quiet) option, which silences various non-fatal
		error messages.

2003-Aug-28:
	22H04:PLD:DEV
		Added bounds checking on Mini-FAT loader, to ensure it would
		not attempt to load up a FAT chain from a negative starting
		sector.

2003-Jul-16:
	21H23:PLD:DEV
		Added bounds check on chain follower/loader so that it would
		not attempt to seek from a starting sector < 0

2003-Jul-11:
	19H53:PLD:DEV
		Added bounds checking to OLE_dbstosbs()

2003-Jul-05:
	01H18:PLD:DEV
		Added --save-unknown-streams facility, this allows saving
			of streams which ripOLE doesn't yet know how to explicitly
			handle.

2003-Jul-04:
	20H52:PLD:DEV
		Posted to Freshmeat
		Applied small patch to stop compile warnings about bp and
		buffer pointers being used (possibly) uninitialised.

	08H13:PLD:DEV 
		Fixed segfault in code when extended-FAT/BAT/DIF was
		required.  This was caused by the header-conversion fn
		because it did not stop attempting to copy sectors beyond
		the first 109.

	00H10:PLD:DEV: 
		Fixed all 3 FAT modes, mini, standard and extended.

		All files now decode assuming they have the 'Ole10Native'
		element-name

2003-Jul-03:
	Initial code release, not currently usable to extract files
		but the code does dump the OLE streams to file, in which
		you can see the attachment information.
